        <p id="pera">
                IIST is the nodal center for virtual lab. Virtual Labs is a project initiated
                 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, under 
                 the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication 
                 Technology. The project aims to provide remote-access to Laboratories in 
                 various disciplines of science and engineering for students at all levels from 
                 under-graduate to research

                It also intends to develop a complete Learning Management System where the 
                students can avail the various tools for learning, including additional 
                web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self-evaluation. 
                There is also a component wherein costly equipment and resources are shared, that 
                are otherwise available to only a limited number of users due to constraints on 
                time and geographical distances. Seven IIT's (Delhi, Bombay, Kanpur, Kharagpur, 
                Madras, Roorkee and Guwahati), IIIT Hyderabad, Amrita University, Dayalbagh University,
                 NIT Karnataka, and College of Engineering, Pune, are the institutions participating
                  in the project. The Project intends to cover physical sciences, chemical science 
                  and various branches of engineering like electronics and communications, computer 
                  science and engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical
                   engineering, biotechnology engineering and civil engineering.
